Purpose:
To have a single script toggle between current sound levels
and mute with the aumix program while maintaining
and not deleting current mixer saved settings.

Notes:
I bind this program to a single key in my window manager's
configuration file.  It then serves the purpose of having a
audio mute key.  If you have a fancy keyboard with a mute
key, try binding this program to that scancode.
